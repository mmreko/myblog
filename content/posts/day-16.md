After two days off to visit my beloved Kaiserslautern and sort some University-related stuff, I'm back in the office ready and hungry for new challenges.



Speaking of challenges, I started my day with 14 _katas_ from my _99 Scala problems_ list. Nothing compares to Scala when it comes to awakening the still deeply asleep brain cells in the early morning. ~~Except maybe two cups of double cappuccino that I eagerly ingested in the meantime.~~ I must say that I was quite satisfied with my progress; my brain must finally be getting used to the functional way of thinking, as I solved problems much faster and in a more efficient way than, say, a week ago. It felt really great to see all tests green and passing. 



Anyways, so far so good. Only 75 more to go!



Up next: my daily tasks.

When I choose my tasks for the day, I usually take a look at my backlog and just pick those where I'm behind the most. This is a method that I tested at the University, where it proved to be more than useful for determining what to study and in which order. It never failed me so far, so why would I change it?



In that spirit, I noticed that I still haven't made much progress in the _Visual Regression Testing_ category. I did rewrite my Tic-Tac-Toe app in JavaScript two weeks ago, but it is still missing a GUI, given that I wasn't familiar enough with React at the time. So it got put on hold.



Luckily, that's where my nerdy side pays off in incredible ways.



Over the past two weeks, whenever I got tired of Scala, I rested my brain by learning about React. I know, the concept of resting after studying with more studying might be weird to some people, but I just can't help it. Learning is what I do best and what I enjoy the most. It is what fulfills me and pushes me forward every single day. And I think that's important; if we are not passionate about the things we do for a living, as well as curious to learn new things related to it, then we are probably doing a wrong job.



So almost every day for the past 15 days, I spent at least one hour with React, its components, prompts, states and events. Today, I am finally ready to use it in practice. In a couple of hours I managed to complete a good part of my GUI, all the while beaming with pride because I successfully added another tool to my toolbox. And which is more: I did it with so much joy, having fun each step of the way, and never for a moment feeling pressured or stressed.



As Confucius would say: _"Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life."_ 



Ain't that the truth.
