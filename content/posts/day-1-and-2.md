Given that I had trouble setting up my laptop, I am a bit late with my first post. I guess I am now famous as the only developer in the office that is using Windows :) Anyways, this post is a 2-in-1, and it describes my first two days as an apprentice in HolidayCheck.

I'm sure I will remember October 1st 2018 for the rest of my life. This is the day when I started my first job, moved into my first apartment, said goodbye to my previous life and embraced a new one with open hands. 

It started terribly though. I got caught in the rain, accidentally stole someone's taxi, got yelled at, froze to death and almost ran late. Me! The person who is never late! I guess there is a first for everything. But once I entered HolidayCheck, my mood instantly changed. I got greeted by so many smiling faces and helpful hands that it was impossible to feel bad. My desk was filled with little gifts. People from every department welcomed me and wished me a happy start. It might sound like a cliche, but I honestly felt like I belonged - from the very beginning. I was nervous, of course. Drank four coffees by noon. But all in all, I could not have asked for a better first day.

For this first post, I wanted to explain why I am doing this apprenticeship in the first place. To clarify for those that don't know: this is a 6-month program where you get to learn, grow, and get a feeling of what software development is like out there, on the big scale. When I accepted this position, I must say I got some weird looks from people. 'Why are you doing an apprenticeship with your Master's degree?' they asked. You know, I may not be like Socrates and claim that I know nothing; I spent the last 6 years studying, so I'm sure something got stuck in my brain. I am more like Aristotle, believing that we learn how to do things - by actually doing them. I never had a chance to work in a company. Actually, I never had the time. I chose to build myself as an engineer through academic studies, but it is just not enough anymore. If I want to master this discipline, art, craft - or whatever it is - I have to get my hands dirty. This program will give me a chance to excel - by reading books, writing blogs, doing coding katas and much more. Hopefully, by the end of it, I will actually be a Master. And not just on paper.

So here I am, sitting at my desk in an almost empty office, trying to finish up this blog before I go home. I spent most of my second day getting the blog up and running, setting up the DNS and summoning inspiration for my first post. I hope that when I upload this you'll all be able to see it, otherwise the struggle was in vain :) In any case, this post marks the beginning of my journey. Now it's time to start working and learning.

I hope you follow me through IT :) Cheers!
