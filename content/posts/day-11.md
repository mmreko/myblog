It was a rather busy day at the office today, so I didn't have the time to write my blog post during the working hours. And that felt extremely weird. Therefore, I couldn't let a day pass by without writing at least a couple of sentences before I go to sleep. 



This only goes to show how attached I got to writing this blog over the past two weeks. Not sure if I chose the right way to go about it though. Perhaps I, as a Software Engineer and aspiring Software Crafter, am supposed to write about more technical stuff? What I mostly do is just ramble about my day and try to include a technical tidbit here and there, if I find it particularly interesting. You see, there are hundreds of technical blogs out there, with tutorials, software reviews and all sorts of interesting things to learn. And a huge number of them can tell about that stuff better than me, more insightful than me, and certainly more educational. I just don't see a point in rehashing what was already said a thousand times before, even if it was in a different way. (Unless it's to help me learn, but I personally use other methods for that.)



Instead, I chose a different way to go about this. I chose to write about my personal journey, about my struggles, hopes, dreams, and small triumphs and defeats that I encounter along the way, in everything I do. Becoming a Software Crafter is just as much about personal growth as it is about professional, so I'd say that's perfectly appropriate. 



With that in mind, I could even call this my diary. A collection of random and a couple of not-so-random thoughts, that were dying to come out and couldn't find another way to do so, except in writing. I've never been much of a talker, and I can honestly say that I suck at expressing myself verbally. Perhaps I suck at writing too, but it makes me happy. 



Ultimately, that's all that matters, isn't it?
