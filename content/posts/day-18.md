Even though Mondays are usually perfect for new beginnings, my tasks for today mostly consisted of tying up loose ends from last week. 



I finally completed the frontend for my Tic-Tac-Toe app, after many hours of debugging (which is an absolute pain when using JavaScript). Of course, it wasn't the frontend that created problems, but the oh-so-magical backend that I _love_ so much. I once read that the strength of JavaScript is that you can do anything, and it's weakness is that you will. Today I finally understood the true implications of that sentence, when I made a stupid syntax error (accidentally wrote `end_with_winY` instead of `end_with_win`) and had the code run without any errors. Of course, it wasn't working the way it was supposed to, but regardless, it did _something_. Where Java, or any other compiled programming language would scream at me for using something that doesn't exist, JavaScript didn't mind. So I spent hours on Friday and hours today trying to fix a mess that a single letter caused. Good job, JavaScript. Good job.



Tomorrow I am planning to start Visual Regression Testing (still don't know what that is) using _Backstop.js_ (still don't know how that works). I took a brief look at [Backstop's GitHub repository](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) and its Readme file, that appeared to be really long, complicated and exhaustive. Let's hope it isn't that tedious to use, as it is to read its documentation.



Next, I completed my List-related Scala katas. `28` down, `71` more to go! I am very excited about wrapping up lists and finally proceeding on to something different (I believe the arithmetic-based ones are next). The List exercises proved to be fairly straightforward (except for the last few that I had to do by glancing at a solution every once in a while), so in summary I am quite satisfied with the way I'm progressing.



Then, I decided to finally set up RSS for this blog, which I probably should have done a week ago. I just got so scared hearing stories from my fellow apprentices about lost posts and broken sites, that I kind of avoided doing that for a while. But today I felt strangely inspired and brave, so I gave it a shot. Apparently, it worked after the first try. I don't know if I was lucky or what, and I certainly have no idea what I did and how I did it, but as the golden rule of programming says: _don't fix it if it's not broken_. Therefore, now you can install [_Feeder_](https://feeder.co/), a Chrome extension for RSS, and click on the button [_Subscribe_](https://mashareko.tk/index.xml) at the bootom of the page. Every time I post something new, you will get a notification in your browser, so you won't have to miss my meaningless ramblings ever again.



It's been a long day already (woke up at 6 this morning, and I am so NOT a morning person), so I'm off to pour myself some coffee and take a look at _bash_, that I managed to completely neglect while being busy with other stuff.

On a different note, other apprentices and me signed up for __The Conference for Software Craft and Testing (SoCraTes)__ that takes place in January in [Finland](https://codefreeze.fi/) (way up north, above the Arctic Circle). Apparently you sign up for it by creating a _pull request_ on their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rinkkasatiainen/codefreeze.fi#readme), which is something I found very amusing. Anyways, looking forward to freezing in the harsh Finnish winter, together with other Software Crafters!



All in all, life's good here at HolidayCheck. May it always stay that way.
