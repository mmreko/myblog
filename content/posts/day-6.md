I hate the fact that time flies so quickly. 

Even though I try not to think about it too much, there are days in the calendar when I simply cannot avoid it. Today is one of those days. It's special, as exactly `INTEGER_OVERFLOW_ERROR` years ago, I said my first hello to the world.



It's been one hell of a ride so far, I must say. A quarter of a century worth of memories - most of them bringing a smile to my face, with just a few exceptions (then again, what is life without a couple of heartbreaks here and there?). And to think that all of that led me right here, to this moment, makes it even more amazing. I never would have thought that doing Scala exercises on my birthday would make me happy, but it did. I realized that I am finally getting to do what I love, together with other awesome people, in a company that cares about me and my personal growth. What more could I ask for, really?



And it's quite fitting, I think, that today is also a so-called __Ada Lovelace Day__. The day we celebrate a woman who made groundbreaking contributions to computer science and beyond. In the time when the world was so strictly dominated by men, Ada Lovelace managed to be the first computer programmer. She studied mathematics and science when women were forbidden to do so, wrote the first computer algorithm, and had ideas so advanced that it took more than a century to have them recognized and fully understood. In her honor, every second Tuesday in October, we celebrate the achievements of women - in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. 



It has always been my goal to be a part of this amazing group of women. Through this apprenticeship, I am trying to push my boundaries and get myself one step closer to this goal. And even though my contribution will likely not be as big as the one from Lady Lovelace, it would make me the happiest person in the world if what I do inspires at least one girl out there to follow her dreams and make them come true.



Let that be my birthday wish.
