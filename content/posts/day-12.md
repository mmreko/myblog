Yesterday I finished with the basics of Scala, so today I decided to treat myself with something different. It was time to include another task to my daily routine, which made me incredibly happy. Adding some variety is always a good thing. Or so I thought.



I took a glance at my backlog, and there it was, staring at me in all its glory - my next task. _Learn bash_, it said. If a task could have emotions, I'm pretty sure it would have laughed. I've spent my whole life running away from Linux, but the chase is finally over. The time has come for us to meet.



I hate Linux. I am pretty sure that by now everyone in the office already knows that, but I don't think it can be said enough times to convey just how much I __hate__ it. The reasons are many, ranging from its incompatibility with many production applications and drivers, all the way to the user experience. I even refused a fantastic laptop just because I couldn't run Windows on it. Little did I know that, ironically, Linux would be waiting for me just around the corner.



Surprisingly, I was somewhat prepared. I promised myself not to be scared of trying new things and breaking away from my comfort zone. So bring it on, Linux. I'm ready.



However, I'm not caving in completely, not just yet. No way I'm installing Ubuntu on my precious machine. Not until I absolutely have to. So I went for the compromise. With the help of my dear friend [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), I had an up and running Ubuntu virtual machine in a matter of minutes. All is well as long as I can turn it off, and go back to the sweet comfort of Windows 10.



I gave my best to tone down my obvious distaste for the way the environment looked and felt, and started slowly immersing myself into the world of shell commands and scripts. I did a short, but quite useful [tutorial](http://linuxcommand.org/index.php) that helped me brush up my knowledge on the basic commands. I thought it would be a good idea to do that, before starting with more complex scripts. In the end, that was enough Linux for me today. Baby steps, I say. Baby steps.



All in all, I must admit that I had _a little_ fun testing those commands and exploring the UNIX file system. Perhaps once I get my hands on more complex stuff, I start having _more_ fun. Stranger things have happened, right?



Who knows, maybe Linux and I even get to like each other in the end. 

(Not that I would ever admit it, though.)
